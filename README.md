# Welcome to the Variational Auto-Encoder Zoo!

Note that this is site currently under construction.

## Introduction

I have been doing amortized inference with VAEs for some time now, and thought 
it would be useful to collect some wisdom about them here. I hope to host the implementations of some 
of the most popular models here, complemented by some notes, remarks and references.

## Set-up

Clone this repository:
```
> git clone https://github.com/gergely-flamich/VAE-Zoo.git
```
