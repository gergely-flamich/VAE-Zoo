      " |  \n",
      " |  Just like any `Tensor`, variables created with\n",
      " |  `tf.Variable(use_resource=True)` can be used as inputs for other Ops in the\n",
      " |  graph. Additionally, all the operators overloaded for the `Tensor` class are\n",
      " |  carried over to variables, so you can also add nodes to the graph by just\n",

      " |  operation on which the read_value depends on (either directly, indirectly, or\n",

      " |  value of the variable from operations that depend on the read_value operation.\n",
      " |  Updates from operations that have no dependency relationship to the read_value\n",
